            <p>The game deals with the characters' survival and escape from the slow collapse of an artificial island.
                While dodging falling buildings and debris from periodic earthquakes, the player must find a way off the
                island. In addition, the main character, a reporter, must investigate the reasons for the disaster.</p>

                    to keep him stable and safe from harm.</p>
